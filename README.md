## Install npm packages


Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```
The npm start command first compiles the application and then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the application whenever a change was made.

> The `scripts` object in `package.json` has property `start` changed to `ng serve --proxy-config proxy-conf.json` which allows to obtain JSON from RESTful Web Service.
